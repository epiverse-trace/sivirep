# sivirep 0.0.1

This is the initial version of the package. It contains four modules which are as follows:

-   `import_data`: contains the functions and logic to import data from SIVIGILA
-   `checking_data`: groups the functions that allow generating distributions of cases
-   `cleaning_data`: contains the set of functions that enable data cleaning
-   `plotting_data`: contains the set of functions that allow generating distribution plots

# sivirep 0.0.9

This version includes a complete refactoring of the package, an R Markdown template called `Reporte Basico` to facilitate report generation for users, bug fixes, and various improvements identified from user testing conducted with the Secretariat of Health of Bogotá, health professionals and students from the Technological University of Chocó, and expert reviews carried out by the Colombia's National Institute of Health.

The modules represent the data flow that the user must follow to generate the automated report, and the functions represent the key variables to be considered for generating a descriptive analysis that facilitates decision-making and the obtaining of key indicators defined in the protocols of events or diseases by the Colombia's National Institute of Health.

# sivirep 1.0.0
